    <h3>URBAN HIKING IN SAN FRANCISCO!</h3>
    <h5>Open on Nov. 16 - 18 </h5>
    <p>Urban hikes are the rustic yet still cool cousin of walking: they normally follow a trail, often begin at a lower elevation and end at a higher one, and they're longer and way more strenuous than your typical saunter to the corner for a cup of coffee. With more people getting into urban hiking as a new way to explore their own cities or to discover new ones, meet-up groups are spawning and city governments are mapping out urban trails. Ready to get hiking? We’ve compiled a list of the best cities and places to hit the pavement with purpose. </p>

    <h4> San Francisco, California </h4>
    <p>Streetcars are for wimps and tourists. If you’re up for the challenge, San Francisco's seismic hills will set your calves ablaze. The architecture, gardens and wild people watching here will make any road you wander down a true adventure. Start with the no-brainer walk across the Golden Gate Bridge and take in sweeping views of the city skyline, Alcatraz and Angel Island. Looking for more nature? Jump on the gorgeous 10.5 mile California Coast Trail. You won’t regret it.</p>

    <div class='modal-body'><p>Urban hiking started centuries ago as a necessity: If you wanted to go somewhere, you had to walk. "Hiking" wasn't for fun. Then, as most people used cars or public transportation to get around in the city, they regarded "hiking" as a pleasant activity to be done somewhere else, in a natural area.</p><p>Our map data are from DataSF <a href='https://data.sfgov.org/'>Mapbox Studio</a> and the <a href='http://www.charlottesville.org/online-services/maps-and-gis-data'>City of San Francisco</a></p><p>For questions or to improve this map, contact <a href='mailto:ah2th@virginia.edu'>Vida Shen</a></p></div>
